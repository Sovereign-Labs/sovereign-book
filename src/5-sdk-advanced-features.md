# Advanced Features

The Sovereign SDK includes many advanced features beyond the core functionality covered in this documentation.

**To learn more about implementing these features in your rollup, just shoot us a message in our [support channel](https://join.slack.com/t/sovereigndevelopers/shared_invite/zt-39aolimfp-XsFK6dL6LhOFHhtXsD_kCA) or fill out our [partner form](fix-link) and we'll reach out to you.**


### Performance & Reliability

* **Configurable delays** – Enable instant cancels & oracle updates while throttling toxic flow
* **Automatic sequencer fail-over** – Seamless failover across data centers ensures your soft-confirmations survive even the worst outages
* **Intra-block caching** – Cache state that's repeatedly accessed throughout a block, eliminating redundant instantiation per transaction and significantly boosting performance
* **Dev-ops tooling** – Production-ready observability and deployment tools

### Integrations & Compatibility

* **Privy integration** – Click-to-sign flow using Privy
* **Ethereum or Solana addresses and wallet support** – Use any address format or wallet you prefer
* **Hyperlane integration** – Bridge liquidity from any EVM, SVM, or Cosmos SDK chain
* **Multiple DA layers** – Run with Celestia, Bitcoin, Solana, or bring your own DA solution
* **Multiple zkVM integrations** – Leverage the zkVM that best suits your application's performance characteristics: Risc0, SP1 (or soon any other Rust-compatible zkVM)


We're happy to help you leverage these features to build production-ready rollups tailored to your exact requirements.
