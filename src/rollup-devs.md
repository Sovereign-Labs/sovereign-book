# Rollup Devs

The chapter will explain the key concepts needed to build your own rollup. It's
divided into 3 sections:

- [Implementing your Business logic as a `Module`](build-a-module.md)
- Composing `Module`s to build a rollup
- Interacting with the chain (CLI, Snap, Rest APIs, RPC, Sequencer)

<!--
TODO: cover

- The `Module, ModuleInfo, BlockHooks, FinalizeHook, TxHooks, and Genesis`
  traits, as well as `Events`, `State` storage/retrieval and `Gas`
- The `TransactionAuthenticator` API and `HasCapabilities` , as well as the
  capabilities themselves: `GasEnforcer`, `SequencerAuthorization`
  `TransactionAuthorizer`, `ProofProcessor`, and `SequencerRemuneration` -->
