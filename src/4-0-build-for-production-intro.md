# Building for Production

In the quickstart, you built a simple but functional module. Now we'll walk you
through the structure of a module in much more detail, taking the `ValueSetter`
as our example. In this section, we'll explain how to take better advantage of
many SDK features:

1.  **Events:** The primary mechanism for communicating with off-chain systems.
2.  **Testing:** Using the SDK's powerful testing framework to ensure
    correctness.
3.  **Wallets and Accounts:** A closer look at how users can interact with your
    applications.
4.  **Advanced Features:** Exploring powerful tools like hooks, custom APIs, and
    configurable delays.
5.  **Performance Optimizations:** How to ensure your module is efficient and
    scalable.
6.  **Prebuilt Modules:** How to leverage the ecosystem of existing modules to
    accelerate your development.

Let's begin.
