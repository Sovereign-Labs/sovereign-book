# Building for Production

This section is a hands-on guide that will walk you through, step-by-step, adding the features and best practices required to make your application robust, feature-rich, and performant.

In the quickstart, you've already built a simple but functional module. We'll now begin by dissecting the concepts behind the code you wrote. From there, we'll dive deep into the anatomy of your `ValueSetter` module and then progressively add:

1.  **Events:** The primary mechanism for communicating with off-chain systems.
2.  **Comprehensive Tests:** Using the SDK's powerful testing framework to ensure correctness.
3.  **Wallets and Accounts:** A closer look at how users can interact with your applications.
4.  **Advanced Features:** Exploring powerful tools like hooks, custom APIs, and configurable delays.
5.  **Performance Optimizations:** How to ensure your module is efficient and scalable.
6.  **Prebuilt Modules:** How to leverage the ecosystem of existing modules to accelerate your development.

Let's begin.
