# Building for Production

In the quickstart, you successfully built, deployed, and interacted with a minimal `ValueSetter` module. You've completed the core developer loop and have a working piece of on-chain logic.

Now, we're going to take that simple module and transform it into a production-ready component. This chapter is a hands-on guide that will walk you through, step-by-step, adding the features and best practices required to make your application robust, feature-rich, and performant.

We'll begin by establishing the core architectural conceptsâ€”the **Runtime** and its **Modules**. From there, we'll dive deep into the anatomy of our `ValueSetter` module, and then progressively add:

1.  **Comprehensive Tests:** Using the SDK's powerful testing framework to ensure correctness.
2.  **User Interactions:** A closer look at how users create accounts and sign transactions to interact with your module.
3.  **Advanced Features:** Exploring powerful tools like hooks, custom APIs, and MEV mitigation.
4.  **Performance Optimizations:** How to ensure your module is efficient and scalable.
5.  **Prebuilt Modules:** How to leverage the ecosystem of existing modules to accelerate your development.

Let's begin.
