# Additional Capabilities

The Sovereign SDK includes many advanced features beyond the core functionality covered in this documentation. The features listed in 
this section are already available or very near completion, but are not yet comprehensively documented.

**To learn more about implementing these features in your rollup, just shoot us a message in our [support channel](https://join.slack.com/t/sovereigndevelopers/shared_invite/zt-39aolimfp-XsFK6dL6LhOFHhtXsD_kCA) or fill out our [partner form](https://airtable.com/app9kbNZcvqdrOidH/shrPlG9rok3sVd8Mh) and we'll reach out to you.**

### Performance & Reliability

* **Automatic sequencer fail-over** – Seamless failover across data centers ensures your soft-confirmations survive even the worst outages
* **Intra-block caching** – Cache state that's repeatedly accessed throughout a block, eliminating redundant instantiation per transaction and significantly boosting performance
* **Dev-Ops tooling** – Production-ready observability and deployment tools

### Integrations & Compatibility

* **Ethereum or Solana addresses and wallet support** – Use any address format or wallet you prefer
* **Hyperlane integration** – Bridge liquidity from any EVM, SVM, or Cosmos SDK chain
* **Multiple zkVM integrations** – Choose the ZK-prover that best suits your application's performance characteristics, with support for Risc0, SP1, and other Rust-compatible ZKVMs.

We're happy to help you leverage these features to build production-ready rollups tailored to your exact requirements.
