# Prebuilt Modules

Here are the suite of prebuilt, production-tested modules that handle common blockchain primitives. Leveraging these modules allows you to focus on your application's unique logic instead of reinventing the wheel.

This page serves as a reference guide to the standard modules included with the SDK.

## Next Steps

While this section of the book covered the core development workflow, the SDK includes many more production-grade features. 

The next section, **"Additional Capabilities,"** provides a high-level overview of these features and how we can help you integrate them.
